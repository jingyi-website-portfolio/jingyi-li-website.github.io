          <h3 class="about__role">
            The 7th ward of Philadelphia is an area bounded by Spruce and South streets and extends from the 7th Street to the Schuylkill River. The ward was the heart of Philadelphia‚Äôs black and immigrant communities at the end of 19th century and was well documented by Dubois in his commissioned research by the university of Pennsylvania. In 1899, the University published his groundbreaking book, <em>The Philadelphia Negro</em>.</h3>
            <h3 class="about__role">
              The 7th ward suffered from seiorus urban decline starting from the 50s because of the proposal of the Crosstown Expressway which would sweep off the whole neighbourhood. The expressway was not built, however, the ward was no longer a vibrant commercial corridor as it was.  </h3>
            <h3 class="about__role">
              Today, the former tenement homes and businesses of immigrant have been converted into trendy boutiques, chic restaurants, old row homes, and expensive new apartments. Because of its unique history, many buildings in the neighborhood used to house important institutions and are homes of famous residents. my app is aimed at improving the community engagement for preserving this unique history and the culture of the 7th ward of Philly.

          Luckily, when working on developing a preservation plan for another Pennsylvanian city Carbondale, I found this website might be used as a prototype for cities and communities who are desired to expand their efforts in storytelling, collect oral histories and promote community-centered cultural resources management. Therefore, I also created one of theses for Carbondale. The video here is a walkthrough of the Carbondale version, hope you enjoy it ‚ù§
